## Project Overview

The Starbucks project was my capstone project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. This data was provided by Starbucks to simulate their customers and transactions to find out  whether a customer will respond to an offer..

The different files that were used to create this project are located in the Profile Portfolio and Transcript Data.zip file. Here is a quick overview of each file:

1. Profile - Dimensional data about each person, including their age, salary, and gender. There is one unique customer for each record.
2. Portfolio - Information about the promotional offers that are possible to receive, and basic information about each one including the promotional type, duration of promotion, reward, and how the promotion was distributed to customers
3. Transcript - Records show the different steps of promotional offers that a customer received. The different values of receiving a promotion are receiving, viewing, and completing. You also see the different transactions that a person made in the time since he became a customer. With all records, you see the day that they intereacted with Starbucks and the amount that it is worth.

Profile Portfolio and Transcript Data

Three JSON files that show profiles of customers, promotional deals that are offered, and the transaction history of customers.

portfolio.json

id (string) - offer id
offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer
reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer
duration (int) - UNKNOWN
channels (list of strings)
profile.json

age (int) - age of the customer
became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account
gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)
id (str) - customer id
income (float) - customer's income
transcript.json

event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)
person (str) - customer id
time (int) - time in hours. The data begins at time t=0
value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record
